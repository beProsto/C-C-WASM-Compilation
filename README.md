## Trying WASM

[C/C++ WebAssembly Compilation Github Repository](https://github.com/beProsto/C-CPP-WASM-Compilation/)

WebAssembly is an exciting technology!

In this project I used clang to compile C/C++ files to WASM.

To compile and run the project on your own, you're going to have to run the `run.cmd` file.

It just needed a small change. :D

This is how it looks like finished:
